webapp-core
===========

Core setup for an isomorphic react webapp. The intention of this will be
to use this as a base module to be imported into individual apps that
includes all of the required scaffolding to get up and running, leaving
it up to clients to implement just the react components and redux
handlers without worrying about other things
